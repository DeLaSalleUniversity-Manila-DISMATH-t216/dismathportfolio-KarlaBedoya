# Week 1:
* I was intoduced to Discrete Mathematics and what we will be learning for the whole term.
* I learned about different terms that we'll be using such as:
  * Mathematical proof
  * Proposition
  * Logical deduction
  * Axiom
  * Propositional variables
* I was also taught how to use a truth table to prove statements.
* I learned about logical connectives and how they are used:
  * Negation
  * Conjunction
  * Disjunction
  * Exclusive or
  * Conditional
  * Biconditional
* We focused more on conditional statements since it seems to be the most confusing.
* I was introduced to logical equivalences which can also be used to prove statements.

# Week 2:
* I learned about Predicate Logic which deals with more detailed statements.
* I also learned about Quantifiers and its two types:
  * Existential Quantifier
  * Universal Quantifier
    * An example thath proves that a statement is actually not a universal quantifier is a "counter example."
* I was introduced to different terms used in rules of inference:
  * Argument
  * Valid
  * Fallacy
* Note that the validity of a statement is different from its truthfulness.
* After that, we were taught the actual rules of inference:
  * Modus Pollens
  * Modus Tollens
  * Hypothetical Syllogism
  * Disjunctive Syllogism
  * Addition
  * Simplification
  * Conjunction
  * Resolution

# Week 3:
* I learned about the different methods of proof:
  * Direct proof is where we assume p is true and show that q is also true.
  * Proof by contraposition where we assume ¬q is true and then show that ¬p is also true.
  * Vacuous and Trivial Proof
  * Proof by contradiction is where we assume ¬p is true and show that it ends up in contradiction, leading us to know that p is actually true.

#Week 4:
* We discussed about another method of proving which is Proof by Equivalence. 
  * We must show that p q and q p are both true. 
* Another proof that I learned is Mathematical Induction. 
  * There are two steps to use this: the basis step and the inductive step. 
  * Direct proof is used for the inductive step. 
* We then discussed about different definitions:
  * Recrusive/Inductive Definition
  
#Week 5:
* We reviewed recursive algorithms by discussing examples and doing some exercises.
* We started on a new topic called Program Correctness.
  * Program Verification
    * Show that the correct answer is obtained if the programs terminates, then show that the program always terminates.
  * Hoare Triple
    * p(S)q
  * We had a few examples to further understand the topic
* Another topic discussed is Power Series
