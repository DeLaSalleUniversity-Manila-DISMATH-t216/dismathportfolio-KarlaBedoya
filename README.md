# Week 1:
* I was intoduced to Discrete Mathematics and what we will be learning for the whole term.
* I learned about different terms that we'll be using such as:
  * Mathematical proof
  * Proposition
  * Logical deduction
  * Axiom
  * Propositional variables
* I was also taught how to use a truth table to prove statements.
* I learned about logical connectives and how they are used:
  * Negation
  * Conjunction
  * Disjunction
  * Exclusive or
  * Conditional
  * Biconditional
* We focused more on conditional statements since it seems to be the most confusing.
* I was introduced to logical equivalences which can also be used to prove statements.

# Week 2:
* I learned about Predicate Logic which deals with more detailed statements.
* I also learned about Quantifiers and its two types:
  * Existential Quantifier
  * Universal Quantifier
    * An example thath proves that a statement is actually not a universal quantifier is a "counter example."
* I was introduced to different terms used in rules of inference:
  * Argument
  * Valid
  * Fallacy
* Note that the validity of a statement is different from its truthfulness.
* After that, we were taught the actual rules of inference:
  * Modus Pollens
  * Modus Tollens
  * Hypothetical Syllogism
  * Disjunctive Syllogism
  * Addition
  * Simplification
  * Conjunction
  * Resolution
