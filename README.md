# Week 1:
* I was intoduced to Discrete Mathematics and what we will be learning for the whole term.
* I learned about different terms that we'll be using such as:
  * Mathematical proof
  * Proposition
  * Logical deduction
  * Axiom
  * Propositional variables
* I was also taught how to use a truth table to prove statements.
* I learned about logical connectives and how they are used:
  * Negation
  * Conjunction
  * Disjunction
  * Exclusive or
  * Conditional
  * Biconditional
* We focused more on conditional statements since it seems to be the most confusing.
* I was introduced to logical equivalences which can also be used to prove statements.

# Week 2:
* I learned about Predicate Logic which deals with more detailed statements.
* I also learned about Quantifiers and its two types:
  * Existential Quantifier
  * Universal Quantifier
    * An example thath proves that a statement is actually not a universal quantifier is a "counter example."
* I was introduced to different terms used in rules of inference:
  * Argument
  * Valid
  * Fallacy
* Note that the validity of a statement is different from its truthfulness.
* After that, we were taught the actual rules of inference:
  * Modus Pollens
  * Modus Tollens
  * Hypothetical Syllogism
  * Disjunctive Syllogism
  * Addition
  * Simplification
  * Conjunction
  * Resolution

# Week 3:
* I learned about the different methods of proof:
  * Direct proof is where we assume p is true and show that q is also true.
  * Proof by contraposition where we assume ¬q is true and then show that ¬p is also true.
  * Vacuous and Trivial Proof
  * Proof by contradiction is where we assume ¬p is true and show that it ends up in contradiction, leading us to know that p is actually true.

#Week 4:
* We discussed about another method of proving which is Proof by Equivalence. 
  * We must show that p q and q p are both true. 
* Another proof that I learned is Mathematical Induction. 
  * There are two steps to use this: the basis step and the inductive step. 
  * Direct proof is used for the inductive step. 
* We then discussed about different definitions:
  * Recrusive/Inductive Definition
  
#Week 5:
* We reviewed recursive algorithms by discussing examples and doing some exercises.
* We started on a new topic called Program Correctness.
  * Program Verification
    * Show that the correct answer is obtained if the programs terminates, then show that the program always terminates.
  * Hoare Triple
    * p(S)q
  * We had a few examples to further understand the topic
* Another topic discussed is Power Series

#Week 6:
* We started on a new topic which is Functions
  * A function f is an assignent of exactly one element of B to each element A
  * One-to-one function or injection is where you can't assign the same value to two different domain elements.
  * Onto function or subjection is where functions have equal range and domain.
  * One-to-one corresponence or bijective is both one-to-one and onto.
 
#Week 7:
* We did not have classes this week.

#Week 8:
* We started discussing about algorithms.
  * Algorithm is a finite set of precise instructions for performing a computation or for solving a problem.
  * One example of algorithm is finding the maximum value in a finite sequence. A step by step process is:
    * Set temporary maximum equal to first integer of the sequence.
    * Compare to the next integer in the sequence. If it is larger that the temporary max, set it to temp max.
    * Repeat until there are no integers left in the sequence.
* I learned about the use of pseudocode which is a description of algorithm written in the structure of a programming language but is for human reading.
* I also learned about searching algorithms.
  * It is the problem of locating an element in an ordered list.
  * We discussed the two types of searching algorithms which are:
    * Linear search
    * Binary search
 
#Week 9:
* We were introduced to different types of sorting algorithms.
  * The first is bubble sort algorithm where it compares adjacent elements and then interchange them if they are in the wrong order.
  * Another is Insertion sort algorithm where it inserts elements in proper order.
* We were also taught of greedy algorithms which selects the best choice of each step instead of considering all sequences of steps.

#Week 10:
* We started discussingabout growth of functions.
  * This is often describe using Big-O notation.
  * Big-O notation can be used to estimate the sum of the first n positive integers, or for factorials.
  * We also learned about big-omega and big-theta notation.
  * Big-o is for upper bound, bog-omega is lower bound, and big theta is both upper and lower bound.
* This week we also learned about algorithm time complexity
  * Constant complexity
  * Logarithmic complexity
  * Linear complexity
  * n log n complexity
  * polynomial complexity
  * exponential complexity
  * factorial complexity
* I learned about division and modulo
  * this can be described with the equation a = dq + r

#Week 11:
We didn't have classes this week.

#Week 12:
* We discussed about our project for this course.
* We started with a new topic with Graph Theory.
* Graph is a discrete structure consisting of vertices and edges that connect them.
  *  ◯ - vertex
  *  ___ - edge
